Level1:
    touch at 0x4017c0
    the prev address is stored on rsp + 0x28
    we need a string to fill the 40 bytes and change the address with 4 bytes

level2: use push to change the return address of the code
level3: to protect the injection string from the random moving, put the char in test's stack frame
level4: 
    put the cookie on the top of the stack
    then pop and mov
    pop %rax  58
    mov %rax  48 89 c7

    we can find 58 90 c3 in addval_219 and 48 89 c7 c3 in addval_273
    their address are 0x401917ab, 0x401917a2

    pop -> cookie -> mov -> touch2
